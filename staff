								<h2>Alex Gurevich - Executive Director</h2>
								<p>Alex was born and raised in Jersey City. His previous jobs have included theater carpenter, stagehand and rigger. He recalls his first job as delivery boy for a florist shop, biking all around JC delivering bouquets. Alex&#39;s father, Grigory Gurevich, formed Arts on the Hudson to benefit the community in Jersey City in the early 80s, when there was no such directive in the city. Growing up, Alex attended many of the Arts on the Hudson after-school classes giving him the opportunity to try out and learn about many forms of art. Because of these programs, he believes he has been permanently impacted and has become a strong advocate of the arts. Alex has been involved with Arts on the Hudson alongside his father since he was a kid, and now is so excited to revitalize and adapt the initiative to continue to serve the Jersey City arts community. </p>

								<h2>Chris Colonnese - Production Manager</h2>
								<p>Chris was born in Central Jersey, and has found a home in one city of New Jersey after another. The sense of community in the Jersey City arts scene, however, has proven itself more powerful than the pull of rampant nomadicism and, since 2014, the Heights have been home. Chris is a multi-instrumentalist with a love for New Jersey&#39;s underground punk scene, and a DIY approach to projects . Chris has worked as a high school teacher for 8 years now.  Chris looks forward to working with and connecting artists of a diversity of backgrounds and media as AOTH expands and unites the art scene of the greater Jersey City metropolitan community and beyond! </p>

								<h2>Karla Aybar - Administrative and Teaching Assistant</h2>
								<p>Karla was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to Jersey City when she was three. Growing up, she was very involved with theater and believes this positively shaped a large part of her identity. Karla recalls how it was through art programs she felt she was a part of her community, so she thrilled to reconnect with the community through Arts on the Hudson. Karla has worked with children all her life and most recently was a counseling intern, learning more about childhood psychology and development. She is excited about providing a platform through which people who might not otherwise be able to express themselves have access to the support and materials they need to realize their creative goals.</p>

								<h2>Katarina La Poll - Creative Content Director</h2>
								<p>Katarina was born and raised in the Bay Area, California and moved to NYC roughly 5 years ago wanting to immerse herself in the vibrant arts community. She met the creatives behind Arts on the Hudson after being cast in a film by Alex and Chris, a kind of &#39;Jersey City Alice in Wonderland&#39; tale, two summers ago. Since then she has been collaborating with members of Arts on the Hudson, and is excited to join the team as she strongly believes in the the mission. Katarina has worked with elementary school arts education programs in CA and as an editorial/advertising assistant in NYC writing and promoting camp/after-school programs for K-12. She is currently pursuing her MFA in Creative Writing and is excited to share her love of theater, dance, and poetry with Arts on the Hudson. </p>
